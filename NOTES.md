- reflections should be vertical if they are skewed, then there is likely a problem during merge
- one reason for this skew is merging. remember that this is not a mindless interpolation at 0.25/0.75 it's a bit more involved because the lower level will have a probe in a negative cell relative to the upper cascade.
