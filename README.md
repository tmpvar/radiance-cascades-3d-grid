# radiance-cascades-3d-grid

This is a rough/unoptimized implementation of Radiance Cascades in c++/opengl. For a 2D version see [tmpvar's radiance cascades 2D playground](https://tmpvar.com/poc/radiance-cascades/).

This is currently unrunnable because it relies on an unreleased hot-reloading platform wrapper (HotCart).

Good Luck XD
